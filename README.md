# Sigstore Community

Welcome to the Sigstore Community repository! This is the community hub for all things related to the Sigstore project. 

Sigstore is an open source initiative dedicated to improving the security of the software supply chain. Whether you're a developer, contributor, or just interested in what we're doing, you've come to the right place.

## Communication Channels

We believe in fostering an inclusive community. Here are the main communication channels:

### Slack

Join our community conversations on [Slack](https://sigstore.slack.com). It's the primary platform for real-time discussions, questions, and collaboration. You can request an invitation through [this invite link](https://join.slack.com/t/sigstore/shared_invite/zt-1z7jzpemb-xEKSUtpgDFXpIEMwMYZQKQ).

### Mailing List
For more formal and infrequent communications, such as release announcements and important updates, we use the [Sigstore Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/sigstore-dev). This group is open to the public, and anyone can join. Shared documents related to the project may also be posted here, so consider joining to stay in the loop.
