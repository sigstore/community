## Community Meetings

We now have a community calendar [available here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=ZnE0a2dvbTJjZTQzaG5jbmJjZmphMmNrMjBAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ).
All recurring and one-off meetings will be shared here.

We typically meet for a community wide meeting every [Tuesday @ 16:30 UTC
time](https://dateful.com/eventlink/1067430297).
This is available via the shared calendar above.

We also used to use a specific calendar invite for the weekly call.
This direct link will continue to work as well, and is available
[here](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=Njc2b2xoYTlkamdlaGN1MTMza3ZoM21iZXZfMjAyMTAzMTZUMTczMDAwWiBkbWk5M3Nibjl0OTJqZTlobXVodXVsYnZma0Bn&tmsrc=dmi93sbn9t92je9hmuhuulbvfk%40group.calendar.google.com&scp=ALL)
